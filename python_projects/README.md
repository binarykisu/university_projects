# Introduction

Here I have uploaded a couple of coding projects that were assigned to me during a Python course in University. These are fairly small coding projects, so not too much needs to be said about either of them. 
Still, I feel that they are important to share because they each taught me some valuable skills about making my code efficient, organized, and maintainable. 

## Best climbing areas

This project gives users a chance to record information about various hiking/climbing areas and their difficulty levels. One main goal was to learn how to efficiently sort through lists of information or have it ordered
in the way that the user wants. For instance, climbing areas could be returned sorted from most to least difficult, or which ones are the longest in distance. We also worked with multiple classes and learned how to stay organized when doing so.

## Study credits

This project takes in information about student's university courses, such as their names and number of credits. The main goal here was to practice _functional_ programming by using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`
methods. The code should be able to return the student's average grade from all courses, along with filtering out those which the student failed.

## Delivery fee calculator

This project calculates the delivery fee a customer will pay when they place orders from a restaurant online. In particular, this project practices using an HTTP API (with a single POST endpoint) to calculate the fee based on factors such as the the cart value, number of items in the cart, time of the order, and delivery distance. It returns the calculated delivery fee in the response payload (all in JSON format).
