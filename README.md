Hi, and welcome to my **university assignments** repository! 

Here I have compiled a small selection of assignments that I feel were the most memorable, important, or that taught me many new skills.  All of the projects in this repository involve programming or working with data analysis and visualization.
My programming language of choice in University was Python, so that's what you will find here.

Thanks for stopping by, and if you have any comments/questions/critiques, please feel free to share that with me! I am still fairly new in the world of programming and data science, so I have a lot to learn.
