Hi, and welcome to my **university projects** repository! 

Here I have compiled a small selection of assignments that I feel were the most memorable, important, or that taught me many new skills.  All of the projects in this repository involve programming or working with data analysis and visualization.
My programming languages of choice in University were Python and MATLAB, so that's mostly what you will find here.

Thanks for stopping by, and if you have any comments/questions/critiques, please feel free to share that with me. I love knowing that I will always have a lot to learn, and fresh perspectives are exciting!
